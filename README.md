# DUCKDOLL: QUACK OUT

Make sure you are on the default branch (master)

The minimum requirement is simply having a card that supports either DirectX 11 or 12
RTX 3060 / RX 6700 XT or higher is recommended

We are currently using Unreal 5.5.3 (Discontinued Unity, and nuked all old progress)

Make sure when you pull (if programmer), to build the solution in Visual Studio, close, right click the uproject file, click show more options (If Windows 11), select generate project files, then you can open the project and work on it freely!
